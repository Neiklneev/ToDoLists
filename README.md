YO what up


THIS IS A REPO I MADE ON FLASK IN PYTHON.
It has user Authentication, hashed passwords in the database using library Flask-Bcrypt.

This is an app for your todo lists. Simply sign up, login then you will see your own private to-do lists that nobody else can access in a nice bootstrap style cuz why not.

This is coming from a guy who used to use django, and FLASK IS SO EASY NOW!!!


Anyways hope you enjoy. Thx
